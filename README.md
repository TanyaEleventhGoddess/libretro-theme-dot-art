# XMB Dot-art Theme

The original icons are found in
http://yspixel.jpn.org/icon/index.html

If you want to contribute, icons should ideally be drawn in 32x32 pixels then resized to 256x256.

## Theme Font
 * By default this theme uses the [M+ P Type-1 Regular](http://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/design.html#mplus_p1) typeface by the [M+ Fonts Project](http://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/) covered under the [Free License](http://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/about-en.html#license).
 * However I found out JMH Chtulumbus Arcade UG works too as a replacement
